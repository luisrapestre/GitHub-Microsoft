## Step 4: Complete the Import

It's time for the big move! Since your source code is in Subversion, Mercurial, Team Foundation Server, or another Git repository, you can move it to GitHub using **GitHub Importer**. GitHub Importer doesn't bring over every piece of data, but it does bring the history. You can read more about GitHub Importer's capabilities [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-importer/).
