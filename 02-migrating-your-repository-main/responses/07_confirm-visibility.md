## Step 3: Private or Public?

You have one more decision to make before you migrate your code! Right now, your repository is set to {% if private %}private{% else %}public{% endif %}.

You can change the visibility of a repository to Private or Public at any time in your repository's **Settings** tab, but there are some things you should know.

### Private Repositories
If your repository is private, the only people who can see your code are you and the collaborators <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#collaborator)</sup> you've invited.

### Public Repositories
In public repositories, anybody can see your code. Millions of open source repositories on GitHub are public, too!

Licenses, code of conduct, and other files are important when you create a public repository. There are many benefits to this, but it's also a large responsibility. Keep in mind that once a repository is public _and_ open source, there are certain implications about keeping it public, depending on the license chosen.

It's important to note that **public does not equal open source**! The license associated with code determines whether or not it is open source.
