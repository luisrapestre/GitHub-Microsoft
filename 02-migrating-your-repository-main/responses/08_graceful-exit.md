As soon as I see code in this repository, I will close this issue and stop responding in this repository. So, before I say good-bye, I want to recap all the tasks you've accomplished. You:

- Learned what to do with an empty repo on GitHub :sparkles:
- Created a .gitignore and removed bulky binaries
- Used GitHub Importer for the first time
- Set your code up in a GitHub repository :fireworks:

After you've migrated your Git repository to GitHub, managing your repository and adding collaborators are common next steps. Here is another course we think you might be interested in:
